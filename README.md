==================

This is an example python script from the wild to be analyzed at the Earth Lab data meetup.
The sample.rar file is a compressed folder containing necessary data. 

### Some potential questions

1. What are some high level suggestions for improving the code? 
2. Are there particular best practices that might be useful to apply?
3. What elements of this script make it easy/hard to replicate?
